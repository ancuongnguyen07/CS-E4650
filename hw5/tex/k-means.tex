\section{K-Means Clustering and Topic Detection}

\subsection{Clustering Results}
The K-means clustering approach was employed to identify thematic groupings within the dataset. The optimal number of clusters $K$ was determined by minimizing the Davies-Bouldin Index (DBI), a metric that evaluates the quality of clustering by measuring intra-cluster similarity and inter-cluster separation. The best clustering result was achieved with $K = 6$, yielding a Davies-Bouldin Index of $6.18$. This indicates a high-quality clustering configuration with well-separated and compact clusters.

\subsection{Analysis of Unigrams and Bigrams}
To understand the thematic composition of the clusters, frequent unigrams and bigrams were extracted from each cluster. Text preprocessing steps included tokenization, removal of stopwords, stemming/lemmatization, and filtering out numeric and punctuation tokens. Table~\ref{tab:ngrams-clusters} summarizes the most frequent unigrams and bigrams for each cluster.

The frequent terms and phrases highlight the thematic focus of each cluster. For instance, Cluster 1 is characterized by discussions on ``Programming Parallel Computers'', while Cluster 2 focuses on ``Cryptography and Cloud Computing''. Similar thematic insights were derived for other clusters.
